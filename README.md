# Numerical-Computation-Final-Project
Final Group Project for Manhattan College's Numerical Computation Class

Created by myself, Sam Skinner, and Maireed Fee.

Taksed with implementing the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi Method into a program and also build an interface that can be used to import data, compute options, and show the final result.
Each individual also had to implement their own functions for each method (included for project completeness).

UI created using MatLab's internal AppDesigner program.
Programmed in MatLab's own proprietary language.
